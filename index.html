		About me
		</h1>

        <article>
            <p>I'm Timothy Bates. Born and raised in Adelaide, South Australia.
			<p>
			I currently work at BAE Systems Australia, responsible for the design, implementation, and ongoing maintenance of networking infrastructure across geographically diverse locations. I have a strong interest in understanding how things work, pentesting, network engineering, and security.
			<p>
			<p>
			I'm an all-rounder due to my ability to jump into various situations and get the ball rolling immediately. I can effectively communicate with all levels of stakeholders to deliver technically complex solutions.
			<p>
			I am passionate about all things aviation and meteorology and am happy to talk about them for hoursâ€”just ask. I hold an Australian Private Pilot License with over 200 hours of total flight time and the following endorsements:
			<ul>
				<li>Manual Propeller Pitch Control (MPPC)</li>
				<li>Tail Wheel Undercarriage (TWU)</li>
				<li>Instrument Rating (SEA, VORL, NGNSS, DEPS, NVORL, RNP2D)
			</ul>
			<h1>

			Current Pursuits
			</h1>
			<p>
			I am currently pursuing personal growth within cloud services, with a focus on Amazon Web Services (AWS). Within AWS, I have successfully set up a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) to an Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) instance hosting a WordPress site. 
			This setup includes:
			<ul>
				<li>Public Subnets to provide an Elastic IP address for the EC2 instance</li>
				<li>Internet Gateways to provide bi-directional Internet access</li>
				<li>Amazons Relational Database Service (RDS) for the private wordpress database</li>
			</ul>
			Additionally, this website is hosted within a Simple Storage Service (S3), secured with an Amazon HTTPS certificate, delivered to you via CloudFront with DNS hosted on Cloudflare.
